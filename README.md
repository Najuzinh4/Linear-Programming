# Linear-Programming
Simplex Method for Linear Programming
This project is a collaborative effort by me (Ana Júlia), Eminny, Júlia and Leticia to implement a computational program that solves Linear Programming Problems (P.P.L.) using the Two-Phase Simplex Method. The goal is to provide an easy-to-use tool for solving optimization problems.
Features
Two-Phase Simplex Method: The program utilizes the Two-Phase Simplex Method to handle linear programming problems, ensuring accuracy and reliability.

User-Friendly Interface: The program is designed for ease of use, with clear instructions and prompts to guide the user through the input process.

Commented Code: We have added comprehensive comments throughout the codebase, explaining the key sections and logic to facilitate understanding and potential future modifications.
